# Absolute legit Hyronic Survival Setup

⚙️ Setup status: 95% done – I got lazy at the finish line 😅

🧩 Missing:
- **Oraxen** (because decorating with item frames is for peasants)
- Full MMO plugin squad: **MMOItems**, **MMOInventory**, etc.
- **MythicDungeons**, **Citizens**, and friends

📦 Running on **Paper 1.20.1**. Oraxen isn't baked in, but feel free to toss it in and make it spicy.

✅ Everything else should work like a charm. Have fun breaking stuff!

Run this command :
`curl -sSL "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/qhuyluvyou/Hyronic-Backup/refs/heads/main/setup.sh" bash`
