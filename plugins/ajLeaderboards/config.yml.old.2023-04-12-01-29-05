# Should this server update player stats?
#  If disabled, stats will not be recorded to the database, and ajleaderboards will basically only read from it.

# Should we block the server when loading placeholders?
# If this is true, it can cause some lag when the placeholders first get loaded, but that only happens once

# Usually this isnt an issue, but if you see lag from ajLeaderboards and you dont have head blocks, maybe disable this
